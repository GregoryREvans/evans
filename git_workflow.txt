create and clone a repository:
    create new repo on github website
    include gitignore
    copy repo link
    enter shell
        change to intended directory
        type: git clone [insert repo link]
        return




push new commit to github:
    save file
    go to shell
        enter directory of repo/file
        type: git status (to see what has changed since last push)
        if all changes are to be pushed, type: git add .
        (optional git status)
        if commit is intended, type: git commit
        type: git push




going back to past repositories:
    optional: make new clone in safe location
    git checkout <hash found in commits>
        explore to heart's desire
    optional: fix errors
    git checkout master

merging vs rebasing branch from master:
    git merge: preserves history but makes history more verbose
    git rebase: bases new branch on the most recent update of master

    give preference to the following:
        git checkout greg/dev -> git merge master
