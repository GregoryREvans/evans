`Perllan` is a network of `Python` (https://www.python.org/) packages which wrap the `Abjad API for Formalized Score Control` (https://abjad.github.io/).

Perllan lets you:

-   calculate and transform abstract pitch and interval material with ``abjadext.microtones``
-   formalize and render segments of `Lilypond` scores with ``evans``
-   generate complex timespan lattices with ``tsmakers``

..  note:: This documentation represents the development branches of packages under **heavy** development, and therefore may **not** be stable and may **not** represent the functionality of any main branches.

``Perllan`` is compatible with Python 3.6+.
